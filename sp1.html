   Some reasons for using overlay networks include different needs regarding privacy, robustness,
   routing topologies, identifier spaces, mobility or scaling. Solving parts of the problem in
   an overlay abstracts networking problems so one does not need to deal with them in the
   application. Overlay networks can also be used to experiment with different Internet designs.
   Overlays also isolate complex designs from each other, so a bug in one overlay should not in
   many cases affect the operation of other overlays.
</p>

   There are practical, political and technological reasons why the Internet can not be
   rapidly changed. Updates need to be carried out incrementally while the system is in
   operation. Lots of effort has been invested into creating infrastructure that optimise
   efficiency of existing protocols. Some of the infrastructure would need to be replaced
   to upgrade the Internet. As Internet is federated, all of the participants would need
   to agree on the correct upgrades to make before they could be made. Finally supporting
   multiple different kinds of operation is complex, and agreeing on a simple set of
   base functionality is easier to carry out in general.
</p>
<p>
   The upgrade from IPv4 to IPv6 can be seen as an example of an attempt to upgrade the
   Internet. In 2011 IANA ran out of IPv4 addresses [1]. Still full IPv6 transformation
   has yet to happen. Tunneling technologies such as Teredo are used to transfer IPv6
   traffic over is tunneled over the IPv4 network [2]. Thus, it seems we end up
   building overlay networks even when we originally do not intend to.
</p>
<p>
There are on-going attempts to lower the barrier for modifying networking equipment.
The research field is called "software defined networking" (SDN).
Reprogramming network equipment makes it possible to run custom protocols efficiently.
SDN also makes it possible to reuse the networking equipment for different purposes.
How far this can be taken, remains to be seen.

   There are several reasons why native networks can perform better than overlays can.

   The overlay user may not be able to take advantage of all the features provided by
   the underlay if the overlay abstraction hides those features. For example a wifi
   network supports broadcasting messages to everyone over radio, but an overlay
   might hide the functionality, providing only support for unicast communication
   between the nodes.
</p>
<p>

   The overlay may also add extra information, such as alternative addressing to the
   nodes. The addresses need to be stored in message headers, and might not be
   necessary, as the underlay might already provide a functional addressing scheme.
</p>
<p>

   The overlay might not understand the topology of the underlay. Thus the same
   traffic might pass multiple times over the same link in the underlay before
   it arrives to its destination. The communication from your computer to a friend
   sitting next to you on a couch might travel to a foreign country and back,
   as there might not be a connection between your computers in the overlay
   despite that share the same local area network.
</p>
<p>

   Using an overlay may have a negative effect on security and privacy as using
   an overlay may increase the amount of computers that can access your data
   while it is in transit, and may increase your amount of open connections
   as well.
</p>
<p>

   Overlays may be costly to users as they move the requirement for processing
   power and network bandwidth from the data center towards the end hosts.
   This may decrease the battery life of the end user mahines.
</p>
<p>

   Finally, design problems in overlay protocols, may cause them to amplify
   user actions. Malicious users can harness broken overlay systems to perform
   Denial of Service attacks.
</p>
<p>

   Using overlays also adds general complexity. For example networking
   problems may become harder to debug when parts of the interactions
   happen on another level.

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

<p>The following stack is presented in the lecture slides.</p>
<pre>
routing
topology
network
</pre>
<p>The network layer is responsible for providing some means for communication. The topology layer takes care of parting and joining nodes and builds them into a network of some shape. The routing layer is responsible for figuring out how requests and responses should be forwarded so they would reach their intended destination.</p>

<p>While the course book presents something like...</p>
<pre>
application
services
resource management
security
routing
network
</pre>
<p>
The network and routing layer are similar to the model from lecture slides. Security above routing is used to secure content that is being delivered. Security could also be below routing to secure the delivery pipes. Or both the content and the pipes could be secured, also all layers contribute in one way or another to the secure operation of a system. The resource management layer allocates resources such as network bandwidth or storage space. Finally the services layer reveals different functionalities of the overlay to the application that runs on application layer.

<p>The TCP/IP stack (I) is as follows.</p>
<pre>
I_application
I_transport
I_internet
I_link
</pre>

<p>For the sake of simplicity I will only go through the exercise with one overlay stack (O). I'll pick the smaller one, but I'll add an application layer on top. We'll end up with...</p>
<pre>
O_application
O_routing
O_topology
O_network
</pre>

<p>One way to think about this is that the overlay stack is the application for the TCP/IP stack (I_application = O_network + O_topology + O_routing + O_application). In this case we replace the application layer of the TCP/IP stack with the overlay stack. Here the O_network layer is implemented on top of the I_transport layer.</p>
<pre>
O_application
O_routing
O_topology
O_network
I_transport
I_internet
I_link
</pre>

<p>Another way to think about it is to use the three lower layers of the TCP/IP directly as an implementation of the O_network layer (O_network = I_link + I_internet + I_transport). In that case the stack would look like this...</p>
<pre>
O_application
O_routing
O_topology
I_transport
I_internet
I_link
</pre>

<p>A third model can be derived if we consider the stacks to be open ended. That is, there can be layers above O_application and I_application, and there can be layers below O_network and I_link. This means that we can implement O_network as an application for the TCP/IP stack (I_application = O_network). Once we put the other overlay layers on top of that stack it looks like this again...</p>
<pre>
O_application
O_routing
O_topology
O_network
I_transport
I_internet
I_link
</pre>

<p><em>
While looking at software stack models it may be useful to forget about the
boxes (implementations) and concentrate on the lines (interfaces) instead.

<p>The routing layer of the overlay network borrows ideas from forwarding service on the internet layer. Both have a forwarding service, some addressing, and some way of computing routes hop-by-hop without global knowledge of the network. The topology layer defines the topology of an overlay network, where as the link layer contains the topology restrictions in the TCP/IP stack. The network layer of the overlay network defines the hard limitations that can not be overcome on the layers above. In TCP/IP stack link layer defines similar limitations.
</p>
<p>
The Internet has many properties similar to overlay networks. For example it is an abstraction run on top of other networks. The reasoning behind Internet's design is also similar to the reasoning behind overlay networks. The existing physical networks were hard to change. It was more feasible to combine them with a shared virtual addressing scheme. The term overlay network, however is typically used for networks that can be conveniently changed without requesting permission from providers of the network &ndash; a property that the Internet does not have.

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
a) password for the torrent (tracker, scrape, peers), integrity verification, sometimes encryption key exchange
limiting with scrape
b) consistency, integrity (filenames to separate copies of the same file)
c) meta data with updating possibility (trackers, comment, creation date, torrent editor software name)
</section>

<section>
<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
a) Peers who contribute to efficient operation of the network are rewarded with better service. Part of the bandwidth is allocated for serving new peers who are yet to prove their worthiness. Worthiness is decided based on the capacity to serve rare pieces. Everyone gets some service. Good behaviour is rewarded, but the trade is not exact.

b) Most of the time peers strive to prove their worthiness to choke algorithm run by other nodes. Thus the node needs to get access to some rare pieces to improve its position in the game. In the beginning the node is more desperate and is willing to accept any pieces so it could start proving its worthiness. The end game mode is used at the end of the download when the peer is already likely to have lots of rare pieces. Also, when the node is nearly finished it does not need to gain lots of extra capacity for downloading the few pieces it is still missing.

c) The article states, but does not prove, that the new seed state choke improves performance in the presence of free riders. The problem is that high bandwidth free riders can denial the service of seeds for other nodes, preventing initial dissemination of content.
- increased piece variation, because of the different world views
- more robustness against node failures
Might help new nodes get started faster.
