<h1>Exercise Package III (20 OEPs)</h1>
<p>
Pair work (groups of two people). Four exercises and one turbo challenge. Doing the exercises awards you overlay exercise points (OEPs). There are three exercise packages, each worth 20 OEPs. 5 OEPs will buy you one point in the exam. The theoretical maximum for the exercises is 60 OEPs. Doing all the exercises will grant you 12 points in the exam.

<p>You can find descriptions for the rarest first and choke algorithms in the scientific paper "Rarest first and choke algorithms are enough" published by Arnaud Legout, G. Urvoy-Keller and P. Michiardi at ACM SIGCOMM conference in 2006. At the time of writing it was available from <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2006/papers/p20-legout.pdf">http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2006/papers/p20-legout.pdf</a>.</p>

<h2>The Turbo Challenge</h2>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Disclaimer: The turbo challenge presented below is extremely hard and does not grant you extra points. However a decent solution for the turbo challenge may award some compensation for lack of points in other assignments.</p>

<p>Your friend is attending a course where the students are expected to build web application overlays using WebRTC. Your friend has decided to work on a chat application. A web folder for hosting static web content has been provided by the computer science department. The web folder can be used to deliver static html, javascript and css files, but server side programming is not allowed. Your friend asks you for help.
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>What functionalities does the RTCWeb datagram connection stack have?</li>
  <li>How does a WebRTC application programmer designate the target node for a peer connection?</li>
  <li>In addition to the web server hosting static files, your friend will need two types of overlay specific services. What for?</li>
</ol>
<p>
The IETF RTCWeb working group describes different parts of the wire protocol in separate drafts. The latest version of the datagram connection is described in draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-02. It is edited by Randell Jesup (Mozilla), Salvatore Loreto (Ericsson) and Michael Tuexen (Muenster Univ. of Appl. Sciences). When this exercise package was created it was available from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-02">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-02</a>.
</p>
<p>
While the WebRTC wire protocols are developed at the IETF, the W3C works on corresponding browser APIs. The W3C WebRTC specification draft is edited by Adam Bergkvist (Ericsson), Daniel C. Burnett (Voxeo), Cullen Jennings (Cisco), and previously by Anant Narayanan (Mozilla) as well. The draft was last updated on 16 January 2013. The update includes a complete code example for using the API for browser-to-browser communication. When this exercise package was created the draft revision was available from <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130116/webrtc.html">http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130116/webrtc.html</a>. The code example can be found in the draft under chapter 10.3 "Peer-to-peer Data Example".
