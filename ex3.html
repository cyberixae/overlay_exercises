582615: Overlay and P2P Networks, Spring 2013
</p>

<section>
<h1>Exercise Package III (20 OEPs)</h1>
<p>
Pair work (groups of two people). Four exercises and one turbo challenge. Doing the exercises awards you overlay exercise points (OEPs). There are three exercise packages, each worth 20 OEPs. 5 OEPs will buy you one point in the exam. The theoretical maximum for the exercises is 60 OEPs. Doing all the exercises will grant you 12 points in the exam.

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
<p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a document with your answers to the presented assignments.</li>
 <li>Include names and student numbers of both participants in the document.</li>
 <li>Produce a txt file or a pdf file for submission.</li>
 <li>Name the file <em>snumber1</em>-<em>snumber2</em>-ex3.<em>extension</em><br />(where you replace<br /><em>snumber1</em> with the student number of one student in the pair,<br /> <em>snumber2</em> with the student number of the other student in the pair, and<br /><em>extension</em> with the correct file extension)</li>

<h2>Assignment (5 OEPs)</h2>
<p>
Content-Addressable Network (CAN)
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>What happens when a new node joins a CAN overlay?</li>
<li>How does the amount of dimensions affect the performance of a CAN overlay?</li>
<li>How does the amount of realities affect the performance of a CAN overlay?</li>
</ol>

<p>
CAN is described in the article "A Scalable Content-Addressable Network" by Sylvia Ratnasamy, Paul Francis, Mark Handley, Richard Karp and Scott Shenker. The article was published at the ACM SIGCOMM conference in 2001. When this exercise package was created the article was available from <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2001/p13-ratnasamy.pdf">http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2001/p13-ratnasamy.pdf</a>.

Kademlia is described in the article "Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric" by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazi&egrave;res. It was published in the 1st International Workshop on Peer-to-peer Systems (IPTPS) in 2002.

<h2>Assignment (5 OEPs)</h2>
<p>
Some computer systems use overlay based storage services for name resolution instead of relying on the basic Domain Name System (DNS) alone. To be a sensible replacement for DNS the overlay based name resolution systems need to be secured so that they meet an equivalent or stronger level of security. Bamboo DHT and OpenLookup are some of the overlays that are used to provide name resolution. Bamboo DHT distributes the items between the nodes, while OpenLookup stores each data item on every node. A related experiment (check the reference below questions) seems to indicate that OpenLookup has better performance despite its lack of distribution.
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>How does DNS and the overlay based alternatives compare?</li>
<li>What is an appropriate division of work between an overlay user and an overlay provider in securing the name resolution?</li>
<li>What might be the reasons behind OpenLookup performing better in the experiment?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Use of overlay based systems for name resolution is discussed in the article "Secure Resolution of End-Host Identifiers for Mobile Clients" by Samu Varjonen, Tobias Heer, Ken Rimey and Andrei Gurtov. The article was published at the IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM) in 2011. When this exercise package was created the article was available from <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/gurtov/papers/globecom11.pdf">http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/gurtov/papers/globecom11.pdf</a>.

<h2>The Turbo Challenge</h2>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Disclaimer: The turbo challenge presented below is extremely hard and does not grant you extra points. However a decent solution for the turbo challenge may award some compensation for lack of points in other assignments.</p>

<p>Your friend is attending a course where the students are expected to build web application overlays using WebRTC. Your friend has decided to work on a chat application. A web folder for hosting static web content has been provided by the computer science department. The web folder can be used to deliver static html, javascript and css files, but server side programming is not allowed. Your friend asks you for help.
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>What functionalities does the RTCWeb datagram connection stack have?</li>
  <li>How does a WebRTC application programmer designate the target node for a peer connection?</li>
  <li>In addition to the web server hosting static files, your friend will need two types of overlay specific services. What for?</li>
</ol>
<p>
The IETF RTCWeb working group describes different parts of the wire protocol in separate drafts. The latest version of the datagram connection is described in draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-02. It is edited by Randell Jesup (Mozilla), Salvatore Loreto (Ericsson) and Michael Tuexen (Muenster Univ. of Appl. Sciences). When this exercise package was created it was available from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-02">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-02</a>.
</p>
<p>
While the WebRTC wire protocols are developed at the IETF, the W3C works on corresponding browser APIs. The W3C WebRTC specification draft is edited by Adam Bergkvist (Ericsson), Daniel C. Burnett (Voxeo), Cullen Jennings (Cisco), and previously by Anant Narayanan (Mozilla) as well. The draft was last updated on 16 January 2013. The update includes a complete code example for using the API for browser-to-browser communication. When this exercise package was created the draft revision was available from <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130116/webrtc.html">http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130116/webrtc.html</a>. The code example can be found in the draft under chapter 10.3 "Peer-to-peer Data Example".
