<h1>Exercise Package II</h1>

<section>
<h2>Assignment 5</h2>

<p>Chord is a distributed hash table (DHT) that assigns objects to nodes based on their identifiers.</p>

<p>In the provided file <a href="input.json">input.json</a> you will find a json dictionary. The dictionary contains two lists of Chord identifiers. It has node identifiers stored under key "nodes" and object identifiers stored under key "objects". Your task is to write a computer program that computes the responsible node for each object.</p>




<p>You may pick any programming language you wish. Using a json library is recommended. For example, to get started in Python you might do something like...</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python

import json

input_handle = open('input.json')
json_data = input_handle.read()
input_data = json.loads(json_data)
nodes = input_data['nodes']
objects = input_data['objects']
</pre>

<p>
Generating small inputs for testing your software during the development phase is highly recommended.
You may familiarize yourself with json at <a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a>.

<h2>Assignment 6</h2>

<p>Tapestry is a distributed hash table (DHT) that routes requests based on routing tables.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>How are the routing tables constructed?</li>
  <li>How are requests routed once the routing tables are in place?</li>
  <li>How are new nodes introduced to the network?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Operation of Tapestry is explained in the journal article "Tapestry: A Resilient Global-scale Overlay for Service Deployment" by Ben Y. Zhao, Ling Huang, Jeremy Stribling, Sean C. Rhea, Anthony D. Joseph and John D. Kubiatowicz. The article was published in the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications volume 22 issue 1 in 2004. When this exercise package was created it was available from <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/tapestry_jsac.pdf">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/tapestry_jsac.pdf</a>

<h2>Assignment 7</h2>

<p>The Freenet Project is building and overlay with the goal of enhancing online privacy. Efficient operation of the system is based on a location swapping technique.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>What kind of privacy guarantees is Freenet able to give?</li>
  <li>How does Freenet achieve these guarantees?</li>
  <li>What kind of correspondence do the locations used with Freenet's location swapping have to geographical location?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The basic operation of Freenet is described in the journal article "Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet" by Ian Clarke, Scott G. Miller, Theodore W. Hong, Oskar Sandberg and Brandon Wiley. It was published in IEEE Internet Computing journal volume 6 issue 1 in 2002. When this exercise package was created it was available from <a href="https://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf">https://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
The location swapping algorithm was later introduced as an addition to Freenet's basic model. Ian Clarke and Oskar Sandberg explained the changes in the talk "Routing in the Dark: Freenet's new design" that they gave in December 2005 at the 22nd Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin. The presentation was recorded and published on the Internet. When this exercise package was created it was available from <a href="http://vimeo.com/22488244">http://vimeo.com/22488244</a>.

<h2>Assignment 8</h2>

<p>Sometimes network researchers discuss mathematical network models such as small-world networks, scale-free networks and the power law.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>What is the power law?</li>
  <li>What are the differences and similarities between small-world networks and scale-free networks?</li>
  <li>How is the study of these mathematical models relevant to overlay network research?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The video from assignment 7 should help you get started with the basic concepts, but finding other sources is required.

<h2>Turbo Challenge 2</h2>

<p>Some researchers have pointed out possible flaws in the location swapping technique employed by Freenet.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>What are the presented concerns?</li>
  <li>How do we know whether or not the presented problems are real?</li>
  <li>What could be done to mitigate the problem?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some possible problems are described in the scientific paper "Routing in the Dark: Pitch Black" published by Nathan S. Evans, Chris GauthierDickey and Christian Grothoff at the 23rd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) in 2007. When this exercise package was created it was available from <a href="http://grothoff.org/christian/pitchblack.pdf">http://grothoff.org/christian/pitchblack.pdf</a>.</p>
