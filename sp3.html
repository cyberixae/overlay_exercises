<h1>Spoiler Package III</h1>

<p>
Many course participants were unfamiliar with the rules for doing quotations.
Therefore, no minus points were given for failure in quotation or failure in pointing out sources.
However, please check the list of <a href="problems.html">common quotation problems</a>
to avoid loosing points on other courses. Double check the rules before attempting to do
scientific publications, such as a master's thesis.
</p>
<p>
Direct quotes were ignored while grading the assignments.
Thus, a low score for an assignment does not necessarily imply that the answer was incorrect.
Furthermore, it was possible to get full points regardless of some errors.
Therefore, a high score does not imply that everything in the answer was correct.

<h2>Assignment 9, Spoiler</h2>

<section>
<h3>a.</h3>
<p>
The CAN topology is presented as a wrapping section of x-dimentional (xD) space,
where x depends on the configuration of the CAN instance. Depending on the amount
of dimensions the topology is either a ring (1D), a torus (2D) or a hypertorus
(xD, x&gt;2). In colloquial language tori are often refered to as doughnuts
because of their resemblance to a bakery product. Each CAN node is responsible for a
zone in the CAN topology. Neighbours in the topology maintain connections to each other.
The shape of a zone also depends on the amount of dimensions. A zone can be a line
segment (1D), a rectangle (2D), a cuboid (3D) or a hypercuboid (xD, x&gt;3).
</p>
<p>
When a new node joins the CAN network a random coordinate is selected as the point
where the new node gets inserted. The system uses basic routing
to find the node that is responsible for the selected coordinate. The node responsible
for that point divides its zone into two halfs, and the new node becomes responsible
for the objects in one of the halfs, while the original node remains responsible
for the other half. As a zone is split the two nodes transfer the corresponding
objects to the new node and update the routing tables of the neighbouring nodes
to match the change. Finally, as the two halfs of the original zone are next to
each other, both of the two nodes add the other to their routing table.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>b.</h3>
<p>
As depicted by Figure 4 in the CAN article, adding dimensions increases routing
efficiency. However, as more dimensions are added, the benefit of adding more
dimensions decreases. Adding dimensions also increases routing table sizes.
Thus there exists a limit how far performance can be improved by adding
dimensions.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>c.</h3>
<p>
The amount of realities refers to redundant copies of the CAN topology in a
single CAN deployment. Each node may end up responsible for different
objects in different realities. Thus, the amount of realities affects the
amount of redundant copies available on the system.
</p>
<p>
The routing performance increase gained from adding
realities is pretty similar to that of adding dimensions, as can be seen
by comparing Figure 4 with Figure 5. However, the cost of adding realities
is higher because of the increased replication.
