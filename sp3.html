<h1>Spoiler Package III</h1>

<p>This spoiler package contains some answers for <a href="ex3.html">Exercise Package III</a>.

<section>
<h2>Assignment 9, Spoiler</h2>

<section>
<h3>a.</h3>
<p>
The CAN topology is presented as a wrapping section of x-dimensional (xD) space,
where x depends on the configuration of the CAN instance. Depending on the amount
of dimensions the topology is either a ring (1D), a torus (2D) or a hypertorus
(xD, x&gt;2). In colloquial language tori are often referred to as doughnuts
because of their resemblance to the bakery product. Each CAN node is responsible for a
zone in the CAN topology. Neighbours in the topology maintain connections to each other.
The shape of a zone also depends on the amount of dimensions. A zone can be a line
segment (1D), a rectangle (2D), a cuboid (3D) or a hypercuboid (xD, x&gt;3).
</p>
<p>
When a new node joins the CAN network a random coordinate is selected as the point
where the new node gets inserted. The system uses basic routing
to find the node that is responsible for the selected coordinate. The node responsible
for that point divides its zone into two halves, and the new node becomes responsible
for the objects in one of the halves, while the original node remains responsible
for the other half. As a zone is split the two nodes transfer the corresponding
objects to the new node and update the routing tables of the neighbouring nodes
to match the change. Finally, as the two halves of the original zone are next to
each other, both of the two nodes add the other to their routing table.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>b.</h3>
<p>
As depicted by Figure 4 in the CAN article, adding dimensions increases routing
efficiency. However, as more dimensions are added, the benefit of adding more
dimensions decreases. Adding dimensions also increases routing table sizes.
Thus there exists a limit how far performance can be improved by adding
dimensions.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>c.</h3>
<p>
The amount of realities refers to redundant copies of the CAN topology in a
single CAN deployment. Each node may end up responsible for different
objects in different realities. Thus, the amount of realities affects the
amount of redundant copies available on the system.
</p>
<p>
The routing performance increase gained from adding
realities is pretty similar to that of adding dimensions, as can be seen
by comparing Figure 4 with Figure 5. However, the cost of adding realities
is higher because of the increased replication.
</p>

<h2>Assignment 10, Spoiler</h2>

<section>
<h3>a.</h3>
<p>
K-bucket size affects the theoretical maximum  amount of connections in
the network. With k-bucket size zero there can be no connections.
With huge k-bucket sizes the network has the potential of becoming
fully connected. Thus, increasing the size of k-buckets increases
routing performance, but also increases the routing table size.
Increased routing tables require more memory, and require the host
to maintain a larger amount of connections.
</p>
<p>
Try experimenting with different parameters in the Kademlia Visualizer at
<a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/twruottu/kademlia/kademlia.html">http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/twruottu/kademlia/kademlia.html</a>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>b.</h3>
<p>
Lets consider this question for 5 bit identifiers and hope it generalizes to n bits. With 5 bit identifiers the maximum amount of nodes is 2^5 = 32. With bucket size 0 the routing table does not have space for any nodes.
</p>
<p>
The nodes are divided to different buckets in a way, where half of the nodes are placed in one of the buckets, half of the remaining nodes are placed in the following bucket and so forth until we run out of nodes. The nodes do not store their own identifier in any bucket. Thus, with the bucket size of 32 / 2 &gt;= 16, all existing nodes fit into the routing table.
</p>
<p>
The amount of nodes added with each bucket size increase are as follows.
<table>
<tr>
<th>increased to</th>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>...</td>
<tr>
<th>required additional space</th>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>

<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>0</td>
<td>...</td>
</table>
</p>
<p>
If we integrate this with a pocket calculator we get the following.
<table>
<tr>
<th>bucket size</th>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>

<tr>
<th>required space</th>
<td>0</td>

<td>9</td>

<td>29</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>31</td>

<td>31</td>
<td> ...</td>
</table>
</p>
<p>
Now, by using a plotter we get the following chart.
</p>
<object data="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lc&amp;chtt=Space Requirement&amp;chs=600x375&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chxl=0:|0|19|1:|0|40&amp;chds=0,40&amp;chd=t:0,5,9,12,15,17,19,21,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,31,31,31" type="image/png"></object>
<p>
We look at the plot and believe that the storage requirement increases logarithmically. If we would wish someone else to believe us as well, we would continue with a formal proof that verifies our belief. The proof should probably take into account identifier lengths other than 5 bits.
</p>
<p>
In the analysis above, we estimated the maximum space requirement for the routing table. In practice the nodes are not necessarily aware of all the other nodes that could potentially exist in their routing table. In fact it is not very likely for all the nodes even exist. Even more so because long identifier lengths are often used to make collisions less likely.
</p>
<p>
The Kademlia paper also describes optimizations where memory for the routing
table gets allocated dynamically. The bookkeeping required for the
optimization causes some processing overhead, but saves space when the
routing table is not full.

Part c was pretty much an open question. To get points one would need to
either analyse what the authors claim in the paper, or compare Kademlia
to some other DHT, or analyse an
existing DHT comparison table with Kademlia in it. Perhaps the
comparison table from the lecture slides, or perhaps one from some
scientific article that compares different DHTs.

<h2>Assignment 11, Spoiler</h2>

<section>
<h3>a.</h3>
<p>
Dynamo needs to be performant.
It needs to be able to guarantee lattency and throughtput, not on average, but in the typical case. It needs to support performance contracts where dynamo and the service making use of Dynamo can agree on a sustainable performance level. It needs to support distributing its operation on hundreds of simultaneous storage hosts.
</p>
<p>
Dynamo also needs to provide some reliability guarantees. It needs to be always writable, and it must be able to guarantee that the information has been stored in durable storage. It needs to be completely decentralized so there is no single point of failure. It needs to provide some weak consistency guarantees, but providing full ACID guarantees is in conflict with the other requirements.
</p>
<p>
Further more Dynamo has some administrational requirements. It needs to support adding new nodes easily. The Dynamo deployment needs to be configurable depending on the needs of the application. There must be a way of rolling out hardware updates incrementally. The system needs to support heterogenic hardware, since newly deployed hosts may be more powerfull than the existing hosts. The distribution needs to be symmetrical to be easy to maintain. It does not need to be particularly secure, as it is run in an isolated environment.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>b.</h3>
<p>
Dynamo uses vector clocks as version information on stored objects.
Conflicting entries can enter the system through system failures or
through multiple simultaneous edits. Conflicting edits are stored in
the system and revealed to the application as results of read
operations. It is the responsibility
of the application to solve conflicts. For example, two conflicting
shopping carts can be merged by the application. However, removed
items may reappear in the shopping cart as a consequence of the merge.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>c.</h3>
<p>
Dynamo has been designed for hunreds of hosts. Thus, the routing tables
will be small enough for every node to store them. As the hosts can run
multiple virtual hosts, the amount of entries in the routing table will
be some small multiple of a thousand at its largest. As the system does
not need to scale infinitely it can optimize routing accordingly.
</p>

<h2>Assignment 12, Spoiler</h2>

<section>
<h3>a.</h3>
<p>
DNS has good sides, but it also has its shortcomings.
It is widely deployed and proven to work in practice.
However, it can not efficiently manage rapid updates
and end-users do not often have write access to DNS
records. It is also based on hierarchical namespaces
and is therefore not well-suited for flat namespaces.
</p>
<p>
DHTs can fill in where DNS is lacking, as DHTs can
handle frequent updates. DHTs are also typically based
on flat namespaces. The important question is whether
or not DHTs can be secured to match the security
provided by DNS.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>b.</h3>
<p>
DHTs concentrate on routing and seldom provide
security features such as access control out of the
box. Thus, applications that use DHTs need to
either run custom DHT instances in isolated
environments or accept the low security level
provided by a public DHT.
</p>
<p>
When DHTs are used for name resolution they need to
be isolated to prevent denial of service and
spoofing attacks. Access can then be allowed through
a wrapper service that makes sure write requests
to the system are authenticated. One way to
authenticate the user is to only accept authenticated
HIP connections. In addition to authenticating the user
the wrapper can enforce an access control policy.
With a name resolution service it is natural to
define a policy that lets everyone modify their
address information, but does not let anyone modify
address information of other users.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>c.</h3>
<p>
The goal of the experiment was to measure performance
of the access control wrapper created for the DHT.
For that reason the authors did their measurements
against a single node of each system. Thus, the
measurement gives us little information about how
the two systems would compare in a situation with
multiple nodes.
</p>
<p>
We do not know why a single OpenLookup node is
more efficient than a single Bamboo node, but we
can guess. Maybe some of Bamboo's distribution
techniques cause some overhead. The single node
might simulate some topology, distribute objects
among virtual copies of itself, build routing
tables and forward queries within that virtual
topology. Then again, it might not.
</p>
<p>
Implementation
details could also affect performance. Bamboo
is implemented in Java, while OpenLookup is
implemented in Python. We could try to find
some results on how programs written in those two
languages typically compare. However, the reason
is likely to be more fine grained than
that. Truly finding out would require us to do
some research. Unfortunately, that is out of
the scope of this assignment.
